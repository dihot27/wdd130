      <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
      <p>
         One of the keys to happy and  lasting relationships is the ability to handle conflict.One of the
          questions to ask is:Am I more concerned with "us-preservation" or more with "self-preservation"?
          Answer the following questions;Do you avoid people you are in conflict with?do you give up on 
          the people you are in conflict with?do you attack the people you are in conflict with?do you solve conflict 
          by hurting others?If you have answered yes to any of the questions,you are on the path to distructive conflict.
